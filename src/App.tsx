            <p>
              I am a software developer working at Variant in Trondheim. I like
              to knit, crochet, cook food for my daughter and watch trash on TV.
              I believe there are too few women in technology, and I try to do
              an extra effort in closing the gender gap in the IT industry. I am
              part of the <a href="https://tenknorge.com/">TENK</a> team in
              Trondheim where we organize{" "}

              which is a 2 day programming camp for 13-18 year old girls.

              is a 2 day programming camp for 13-18 year old girls in Norway. It
              is run in four cities (as per 2023), and consists of workshops and
              motivational talks which has the goal of inspiring more girls to
              choose technology related studies and eventually work in the IT
              industry.

            <p>
              I became a mom in 2021 and experienced the highs and lows of the
              fourth trimester. I was often overwhelmed with the amount of
              information and tasks needed to be done continuously in addition
              to taking care of my daughter. I was missing an app that kept
              track of all the things I needed to do in order to make my future
              self more prepared and on top of things. In the first 6 months I
              was in a bubble and couldn't really focus on anything other than
              my family of three. After some time there were less sleepless
              nights and also time to reflect and think of ideas for tools to
              enter this new life as a first-time mom.

              What does a software developer, designer, doctor and influencer
              have in common? We‚Äôre all moms and tired of using too many and too
              poorly designed apps to administrate our family life. None of the
              apps on the market right now fit our needs, so we are creating our
              own. Read more about our project at{" "}

              egg allergy, so we are making almost all food from scratch. We try
              to eat more organic and less ultra-processed food.
